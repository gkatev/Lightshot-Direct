Lightshot Direct is a simple script written in AutoIt to aid the use of the Lightshot program. 
It runs in parallel to the lightshot program and when image of the screen has been shot it parses the result link and gets the direct link to the image. 
In order for the script to work you will need to set lightshot to use the key Ctrl+PrtScrn to take screenshots(or feel free to change this in lightshot_direct.au3). 
There needs to be a key combination that activates the script. By default, PrtScrn activates the script. 
When the script is activated it sends the key combination so that lightshot may be activated.
For the script to work you need to copy the image url to the clipboard. 
This may be done easily by enabling the auto-copy feature of lightshot.
The script listens for changes in the clipboard for 60 seconds after the combination was sent.
When change is detected, the dll created by analyze.cpp is called to retreive the direct link to the image.

Compilation:
You will need autoit(aut2exe specifically) and libcurl(for analyze.cpp)
