Lightshot Direct is a simple script written to improve the the lightshot program.

It runs parallel to it and when desired it signals lightshot to take an image and 
	then monitors the clipboard for a set amount of time for the link to the image.
	
When detected, it analyzes the page and extracts the direct link to the image.

You will probably need to adjust some settings: 
	> The script and lightshot need to have a different activating key
	  By default, the script registers the PrtScrn key and assumes lightshot to be using Ctrl + PrtScrn
	  You may change this setting in lightshot_direct.au3.
	  
	> The script analyzes the result as soon as it is inserted into the clipboard
	  For this to happen you need to either copy it manually or 
		enable auto copying of the link in lightshot's settings.
		
	> The script by default listens for changes for 30 seconds. Configurable in lightshot_direct.au3.
	
	> After detecting the lightshot link, it erases the clipboard 
		and pastes the direct link as soon as it is available.
	
	> The script attemps to auto-start lightshot when it detects that it's not running and you therefore
	  need to the set the path to the lightshot executable/shortcut. Set to "" if this is not desired.
	  
The included makefile uses the aut2exe to produce an executable archive but you may 
simply run it directly from the autoit vm. Keep in mind the script creates no tray icon.
